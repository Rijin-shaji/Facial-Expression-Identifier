# Class Distribution

Emotion datasets often suffer from **class imbalance**.
Some emotions (e.g., Happy, Neutral) are more frequent than others (e.g., Disgust, Fear).

## Handling Imbalance
- Class weights during training
- Automatic data augmentation for low-count classes
- Balanced sampling strategy

## Importance
Balanced datasets prevent:
- Model bias
- Overfitting dominant classes
- Poor generalization
